# Zelion Network - Security Audit Scope

**Date:** 2025-08-07

This document outlines the scope and necessary information for the security audit of the Zelion Network's smart contracts.

---

## 1. Commit for Audit

The audit should be performed on the following Git commit hash from the `main` branch of the repository. This ensures the exact deployed code is being reviewed.

- **Repository:** https://github.com/Zelionnetwork/zelion-network
- **Commit Hash:** `560a97a52e48dc652d187a44e94ee34a3e912201`

## 2. Scope of Contracts

The audit should focus on the core production contracts. Test contracts, examples, and deprecated versions are explicitly out of scope.

### In-Scope Contracts (High Priority):

1.  **`contracts/ZelionBridge.sol`**
    - **Description:** The main upgradeable bridge contract handling the core cross-chain logic.
    - **Areas of Focus:** Upgradeability mechanism (proxy pattern), owner privileges, token locking/burning logic, fee management, and interaction with the Chainlink CCIP router.

2.  **`contracts/ZYLToken.sol`**
    - **Description:** The primary ERC20 token for the network.
    - **Areas of Focus:** Role-based access control (especially `BRIDGE_ROLE`), `burn` and `mint` functions, and overall compliance with the ERC20 standard.

### In-Scope Contracts (Medium Priority):

3.  **`contracts/Bridge.sol`**
    - **Description:** The base contract inherited by `ZelionBridge.sol`.
    - **Areas of Focus:** The `_ccipReceive` function, security modifiers (`onlyOwner`, `whenNotPaused`, `nonReentrant`), and event emissions.

4.  **`contracts/overrides/CCIPReceiver.sol`**
    - **Description:** A local override of a core Chainlink contract.
    - **Areas of Focus:** Correct implementation of the `CCIPReceiver` interface and secure handling of incoming cross-chain messages.

### Out-of-Scope Contracts:

All other contracts within the `contracts/` directory are considered out of scope for this audit. This includes, but is not limited to:
- `TestBridge.sol`
- `SimpleBridge.sol`
- `CrossChainTransfer.sol`
- All other files ending in `Test.sol` or `Testnet.sol`.

## 3. Additional Information & Suggestions for Auditors

To facilitate a smooth and comprehensive audit, please consider the following:

1.  **System Architecture:** A high-level diagram showing the interaction between the `ZelionBridge`, `ZYLToken`, and the Chainlink CCIP router should be provided to understand the data flow.

2.  **Owner Privileges:** A clear list of all owner-restricted functions should be documented and reviewed for potential security risks. Key functions include `setChainGasLimit`, `pause`, and `unpause`.

3.  **Upgrade Process:** The process and authority for upgrading the `ZelionBridge` contract should be clearly defined and reviewed.

4.  **Deployment Details:** The deployment information, including the deployed contract addresses on the Arbitrum Sepolia network, can be found in the `deployments/arbitrumSepolia.json` file (from the specified commit).
