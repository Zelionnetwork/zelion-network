# Zelion Network Redeployment Plan

## Notes
- Previous deployments were made with a compromised wallet.
- The new secure wallet's private key and address have been updated in the .env file.
- All contracts (ZYLToken, ZelionBridge) must be redeployed using the new wallet.
- The deployer will have DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, BRIDGE_ROLE, and PAUSER_ROLE.
- Minting of 1 billion ZYL tokens will be done to the designated test wallet after deployment.
- Contract verification on Arbiscan is required after deployment.
- Hardhat config bug found: was caching old PRIVATE_KEY; config now updated to always read fresh key from .env.
- ZelionBridge implementation contract verification requires explicit constructor arguments and may need further manual steps; automated verification attempts have failed so far.
- Manual verification process on Arbiscan is required for ZelionBridge implementation contract. Use Solidity 0.8.20, optimizer enabled with 200 runs, MIT license, and the flattened contract source. No constructor arguments are required.
- Implementation contract address for ZelionBridge found: 0x80b7ea9A8dbd509f799B1B85D223A0d51b1DcEBC
- User is currently performing manual verification with the correct address and settings.
- Step-by-step manual verification instructions have been provided to the user.
- Manual verification via Arbiscan web interface has been initiated; awaiting result.
- Automated verification attempt failed; ensure ARBISCAN_API_KEY is set in .env for future automated verification. Manual verification is the current focus.
- Manual verification failed due to extraneous non-Solidity lines (e.g., dotenv output) in the flattened source file; ensure only valid Solidity code is present before submitting to Arbiscan.
- The dotenv comment is no longer present in the flattened file; only the unused variable warning needed fixing.
- Previous fix with `_srcToken` did not suppress the warning; must use a bare underscore (`_`) to fully ignore the variable in Solidity and eliminate the warning.
- Hardhat config updated to enable Sourcify and migrate to Etherscan v2 API format per latest verification requirements.
- Flattened contract file has been checked and contains only valid Solidity code at the top; no extraneous non-Solidity content is present.
- Unused variable warning in _ccipReceive has been fixed by using a bare underscore in the variable tuple.
- Manual verification failed with Solidity compiler error: DeclarationError: The name "_" is reserved; cannot use bare underscore in tuple assignment in Solidity 0.8.20. Must use a named variable and ignore it or refactor the assignment.
- Correct fix: omit the unused variable entirely in the tuple assignment in the original source file, not just in the flattened contract.
- The original source has now been edited to omit the unused variable in the tuple assignment in _ccipReceive.
- Project is being reset: recloned from GitHub for a clean slate. All local changes are discarded; starting from upstream main branch.
- Project has been successfully recloned, dependencies installed, and contracts recompiled. All subsequent work is on the fresh repo.

## Task List
- [x] Update .env with new secure private key and address
- [x] Redeploy ZYLToken (Upgradeable) and ZelionBridge on Arbitrum Sepolia
  - [x] Clear Hardhat cache before redeployment to ensure new credentials are used
- [x] Assign BRIDGE_ROLE, DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, and PAUSER_ROLE to deployer
- [x] Mint 1,000,000,000 ZYL tokens to the designated wallet
- [ ] Verify contracts on Arbiscan (ZelionBridge implementation contract currently being manually verified)
  - [x] Fix tuple assignment in _ccipReceive to avoid using `_` as a variable name (use a named variable and ignore it)
  - [x] Edit original ZelionBridge.sol to omit unused variable in tuple assignment
  - [ ] Re-flatten ZelionBridge contract after fixing original source
  - [ ] Redeploy ZelionBridge contract
  - [ ] Complete manual verification of ZelionBridge implementation contract on Arbiscan using provided settings (Solidity 0.8.20, optimizer 200 runs, MIT license, no constructor args) and flattened source
- [x] Confirm token supply and roles via Arbiscan and MetaMask
- [x] Fix unused variable warning in flattened contract (_ccipReceive)
- [x] Re-clone project from GitHub, install dependencies, and recompile contracts
- [ ] Apply tuple assignment fix to fresh repo, flatten, redeploy, and verify

## Current Goal
Apply tuple fix, flatten, redeploy, and verify
